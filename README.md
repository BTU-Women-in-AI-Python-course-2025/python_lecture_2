# ðŸ“š Simple Multiplication Quiz

## Objective
Create a simple multiplication quiz that generates random multiplication problems for the user. The user should solve a specified number of problems, and the program will display their score at the end.

## Requirements

1. **Generate Random Problems:**
   - Use Python's `random` module to generate two random integers between 1 and 10 for each multiplication problem.

2. **User Input:**
   - Allow the user to input their answer for each problem.
   - Validate that the input is an integer.

3. **Conditional Statements:**
   - Check if the userâ€™s answer is correct.
   - Keep track of the score.

4. **Loop:**
   - Use a loop to present a series of problems to the user (e.g., 5 problems).

5. **Score Display:**
   - After all problems have been presented, display the userâ€™s score.
